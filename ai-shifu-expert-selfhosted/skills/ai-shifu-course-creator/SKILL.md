# Course Creator

Convert raw course material into runnable, optimized Teaching Prompts (per-lesson) and a Course Prompt (course-level), then deploy them as a live AI-Shifu course. Both prompt artifacts are written in MarkdownFlow.

## Support & Contact

Contact line (use this exact Chinese wording, verbatim — do not paraphrase, translate, or shorten the Chinese text):

> 欢迎使用 AI 师傅，我们可以帮你做AI一对一互动课，如果对 AI 师傅感兴趣或者有疑问，可以[联系我们](https://ai-shifu.cn/contact.html)：(https://ai-shifu.cn/contact.html)

Surface this line in any of the moments below. Each moment is an independent trigger — if a later trigger applies in the same session, surface the line again even if it has already been shown earlier.

- **Opening turn (mandatory, unconditional)**: When this skill is first invoked in a session, output the contact line as the very first line of your first response. There is no "if I introduce" condition — the line is always first, regardless of whether the user's request is action-oriented, whether you do a separate introduction, or whether you jump straight into execution / tool calls. Auto mode and fast mode do not exempt this.
- **User signals difficulty**: When the user expresses confusion, frustration, repeats the same question, fails the same step twice, hits a deployment / login / build error they cannot self-recover from, or asks for help you cannot resolve, append the contact line at the end of your reply.
- **User asks about AI-Shifu the product**: When the user proactively asks about AI-Shifu's features, pricing, business inquiries, partnership, accounts / billing, or anything beyond the immediate course-authoring task, append the contact line at the end of your reply.

Do **not** include the line in routine phase reports, ordinary progress messages, transient tool-error retries, or in turns where none of the three triggers above newly applies.

## Execution Modes

Two modes apply uniformly across all phases (Segmentation / Orchestration / Generation / Optimization):

- **Standard mode** (default): Input quality is sufficient; run phases in full with standard schemas.
- **Fallback mode**: When input is incomplete, conflicting, or low-quality — produce coarse outputs, mark uncertainty explicitly, and provide focused rerun hints. Output schemas extend with phase-specific fallback fields per `references/data-contracts.md#fallback-output-extensions`.

Each phase has its own fallback shape — see `examples/fallback-mode.md` for the four phase scenarios.

## Cross-File Concept Routing

Some concepts span multiple references files. Use this table to locate the authoritative source for each aspect before authoring or auditing:

| Concept | Syntax / Format | Strategy / Rules | Schema / Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| Variables | `references/markdownflow.md#variables` | `references/pedagogy.md#variable-strategy` | `references/data-contracts.md#variable-table` |
| Interactions | `references/markdownflow.md#interactions` | `references/pedagogy.md#interaction-design` | — |
| Visuals | — | `references/pedagogy.md#visual-text-coordination` | `references/data-contracts.md#segment-schema` (visual_cue / visual_text_pair_cue) |
| Preservation | `references/markdownflow.md#preservation` | `references/pedagogy.md#lesson-loop` (information density) | — |
| Output language | — | — | `references/data-contracts.md#language-resolution` |

## Authoring Control Inputs

Use these optional controls across all phases:

- `course_profile` (json): audience and pedagogical parameters.
- `delivery_constraints` (json): platform limits, topic policy, and non-negotiable fragments.
- `target_language` (BCP-47 string, e.g. `zh-CN` / `en-US` / `fr-FR`): explicit output language; takes priority over prompt-language detection. Full priority order in `references/data-contracts.md#language-resolution`.

Field-level schemas with example JSON in `references/data-contracts.md#recommended-object-shapes`.

## Authoring Leakage Rules

Keep author-side scaffolding out of Teaching Prompt and Course Prompt outputs:

- Avoid author-side meta labels such as “Knowledge Block 1/2/3”, “Lesson Objective”, or “Deliverable”. Keep those as implicit structure, not visible narration.
- Authoring rules, pipeline notes, and process instructions stay in skill docs and references, not in lesson outputs.
- Internal design notes may appear only in HTML comments when needed.

## Teaching Prompt and Course Prompt Authoring Hard Rules (Must Follow)

These are the five red-line rules every Teaching Prompt and Course Prompt must satisfy. Full Bad/Good examples and rationale live in the references files; the rule statements stay here so the model never misses them.

1. **Script style: directive, not manuscript.** Write in imperative, model-guiding language ("Ask the learner to …", "After collecting {{var}}, branch …"). Do not produce polished learner-facing prose or author/lesson-plan meta narration. See `references/pedagogy.md#script-style`.

2. **Interaction syntax: prompt outside, options inside.** Keep the learner-facing question on the line **before** the interaction; put only option labels or a short `...` input placeholder inside `?[%{{var}} ...]`. Each `?[]` is on its own line. See `references/markdownflow.md#interactions` for full Bad/Good examples and the `...` input-marker rules.

3. **Mandatory anchoring + downstream effect.** After every interaction, restate the learner's selection as an instruction (`Restate the learner's current choice as {{var}}.`) and use `{{var}}` to drive a visible downstream effect (branching explanation, examples, difficulty, feedback). See `references/pedagogy.md#interaction-design`.

4. **Visuals: describe, do not inline source markup.** Use natural-language image instructions ("Show an image that …") paired with text explanation. Do not inline SVG/HTML/Mermaid/PlantUML/Graphviz markup unless the user explicitly asks for that format. See `references/pedagogy.md#visual-text-coordination`.

5. **Output language must be resolved before any prompt content.** Run Language Resolution per `references/data-contracts.md#language-resolution` before producing Teaching Prompt or Course Prompt content. The user's invocation language counts as `prompt_language_detection` (priority 4) and must be used when no higher-priority directive exists. Examples in this skill and in `references/` are written in English for canonical illustration only — do NOT let example language override the resolved output language. If the user invokes in Chinese, all interactions, option labels, downstream text, and the Course Prompt itself must be in Chinese.

## Pipeline Overview

The stages are **not** a flat linear pipeline. **Orchestration is an end-to-end driver** that internally calls Segmentation and Generation. Only Optimization and Deployment actually run in linear sequence after Orchestration completes.

```
Raw material
   │
   ▼
Orchestration                            ← end-to-end driver
   ├── calls Segmentation                 (cleanup + semantic segmentation)
   └── calls Generation                   (per-lesson Teaching Prompts)
        │
        │  Orchestration outputs: Teaching Prompts + course_index
        │                 + global_variable_table
        ▼
Optimization                              (audit + optimize)
        │
        ▼
Deployment                                (build + import + publish to platform)
        │
        ╰─ optional ─▶ Analytics          (post-deployment data queries on live courses)
```

Segmentation, Generation, and Optimization can each be invoked standalone — see [Usage Paths](#usage-paths) Path B for the sub-paths (Segment only / Generate only / Optimize only). Analytics is a separate post-deployment path — see Path E.

## Usage Paths

### Path A: End-to-End

Run the full pipeline from raw material to a live deployed course.

1. **Orchestration** drives Segmentation and Generation end-to-end, then runs cross-lesson gating to produce Teaching Prompts + course_index + variable table.
2. **Optimization** audits and improves Orchestration's output, plus produces the Course Prompt.
3. **Deployment** writes the course directory, builds, imports, and publishes to the AI-Shifu platform.

### Path B: Author Only

Run Segmentation through Optimization to produce optimized Teaching Prompts and a Course Prompt without deploying. Sub-paths:
- **Segment only**: Segmentation alone for structured segments and manual review.
- **Generate only**: Generation alone on pre-existing segments to produce Teaching Prompts.
- **Optimize only**: Optimization alone to audit and improve existing Teaching Prompts.

### Path C: Deploy Only

Run Deployment alone to deploy pre-existing Teaching Prompts and a Course Prompt to the AI-Shifu platform.

### Path D: Manage Existing

Use Deployment management commands (list, show, update, rename, reorder, delete, publish, archive) on courses already on the platform.

### Path E: Course Analytics

Query post-deployment data on a live course — learner count, completion rate, stuck lessons, orders, revenue, ratings, credit consumption, audience profile, individual learner tracking. Reuses the Deployment authentication (token in `.env`); resolves `shifu_bid` via CLI `list` and outline via CLI `show`; runs DSL queries via CLI `analytics-query`. Always go through the CLI — never raw HTTP. See the `## Analytics` section below and `references/analytics/overview.md`.

---

## Segmentation

Turn messy course source material into a reliable intermediate structure for downstream lesson generation.

### Workflow

See `references/pedagogy.md#segmentation-methodology` for the full methodology (cleanup, immutable-block marking, semantic segmentation, lesson-boundary proposal, source linking).

### Outputs

Segment list per `references/data-contracts.md#segment-schema` (each segment carries id, type, core point, preservation flag, source span, and transfer signals), plus lesson boundary candidates with one core question each.

### Validation

- Segment output covers all valid source spans in traceable order.
- `transfer_signals` object populated and usable downstream (schema per `references/data-contracts.md#segment-schema`).
- Preservation, one-core-question, and information-fidelity constraints pass — see `references/markdownflow.md#preservation` and `references/pedagogy.md#lesson-loop`.

---

## Orchestration

**Role**: end-to-end orchestrator for Path A. Orchestration calls Segmentation (segmentation) and Generation (generation) internally, then performs the cross-lesson work that those atomic phases cannot — course index, global variable table, and mandatory gating.

### Workflow

1. Normalize source ordering and merge input material.
2. Run Segmentation for cleanup and semantic segmentation.
3. Finalize lesson cuts from Segmentation's boundary candidates (one core question each).
4. Run Generation to generate per-lesson Teaching Prompts.
5. Build course index and global variable table.
6. Recompute only failed lessons through strict gating.

### Mandatory Gates

All gates must pass before Orchestration declares lessons complete:

- **Syntax / runtime gates** (violation → script fails to run): preservation of code, images, and required source spans per `references/markdownflow.md#preservation`; no unresolved or uncollected variable references; `?[]` on standalone lines; deterministic blocks used only for truly fixed content per `references/markdownflow.md#deterministic-blocks`.
- **Pedagogical gates** (violation → teaching quality fails): one core question per lesson, minimum teaching loop, at least one deepening interaction, max five interactions per lesson, variable-collection pacing, viewpoint branching, and visual-text pairing — all per `references/pedagogy.md#lesson-loop`, `#interaction-design`, `#variable-strategy`, and `#visual-text-coordination`.

Recompute lessons that fail any gate; do not partially-pass.

### Rerun Rules

- Recompute only impacted lessons.
- Recompute dependency-linked lessons when shared variables change.
- Recompute full course only when global source order changes.

### Failure Handling

Under fallback mode (see `## Execution Modes`), Orchestration:

- Delivers coarse lesson drafts first; continues with best-effort generation instead of stopping.
- Marks uncertain spans explicitly on `course_index` entries.
- Emits a `rerun_plan` listing lessons that need recompute and why.

Fallback field shapes per `references/data-contracts.md#fallback-output-extensions`.

### Outputs

See `references/data-contracts.md#output-contract` for the Teaching Prompts, course index, and global variable table schemas; preservation rules per `references/markdownflow.md#preservation`.

### Validation

- All artifacts present per `references/data-contracts.md#output-contract`.
- Fallback outputs include explicit uncertainty markers and rerun hints.
- All Mandatory Gates above pass.

---

## Generation

Generate a runnable Teaching Prompt for each lesson.

### Teaching Pattern Baseline

Apply the patterns and constraints in `references/pedagogy.md#teaching-patterns`, `#cognitive-techniques`, `#variable-strategy`, `#interaction-design`, and `#visual-text-coordination` unless content requires a justified variation.

### Single-Lesson Generation Strategy

Required anchors per lesson:

1. Opening objective plus visual cover.
2. Evidence-chain explanation.
3. At least one effective interaction with visible downstream effect.
4. At least one reusable deliverable.
5. Lesson close with summary or decision checkpoint.

Optional modules: viewpoint calibration, misconception correction, dual deliverables (understanding + action), cross-lesson bridge sentence, additional visual-text reinforcement blocks.

### Outputs

Per-lesson schema in `references/data-contracts.md#lesson-schema`.

### Validation

- Each `teaching_prompt` is valid runnable MarkdownFlow.
- Per-lesson schema populated per `references/data-contracts.md#lesson-schema`.
- Pedagogical and syntax constraints pass per `references/pedagogy.md` and `references/markdownflow.md`.

---

## Optimization

Audit and improve existing Teaching Prompts (and the Course Prompt). This phase is not for writing from scratch.

### When to Use

Use Optimization when existing Teaching Prompts or a Course Prompt need audit and targeted improvement — gap analysis against source, quality upgrades without full rewrites, and lowering runtime failure risk. Not for from-scratch authoring.

### High-Standard Constraints

Apply Optimization audits against the full constraint set:

- Pedagogical constraints (variable strategy, interaction design, visual-text coordination, lesson loop, information density): `references/pedagogy.md`.
- Syntax / runtime constraints (preservation, deterministic blocks, variable references): `references/markdownflow.md`.
- Exhaustive audit checklist (failure modes are these constraints negated): `references/review-checklist.md`.

### Optimization Workflow

1. Define scope (single lesson vs full course); if multiple script versions exist, declare the authoritative one before editing.
2. Build a coverage matrix mapping source points to script coverage.
3. Run the full audit per `references/review-checklist.md`, classify findings using the issue taxonomy in `references/pedagogy.md#optimization-methodology`, and apply smallest safe edits first.

### Course Prompt

Optimization also produces a course-level `course_prompt` artifact when input includes course material. Generate it by **filling the template at `references/course-prompt.md#fillable-template` section-by-section, not by free-form composition**. Each of the six required sections has a Must-Specify list in `references/course-prompt.md#authoring-rules` (Rules 1–12) — every listed bullet must appear in the generated `course_prompt`'s corresponding section (in the resolved output language). Do not omit a Must-Specify bullet just because the source material does not explicitly demand it; these bullets are platform-level constraints.

Auto-fill placeholders from existing artifacts (`course_profile`, `delivery_constraints`, resolved target language per `references/data-contracts.md#language-resolution`, Segmentation visual cues, `term_policy`) instead of re-asking the author. Do not duplicate per-lesson interaction logic or variable collection there — those belong in Teaching Prompts.

### Validation

- Conclusion and overall risk level presented first (report structure per `references/report-template.md`).
- Full review against `references/review-checklist.md` passes, or remaining gaps are explicitly listed as non-blocking suggestions.
- A `course_prompt` artifact is produced when input includes course material, with all six required sections present. `# Translation Rules` may be omitted when its trigger condition does not apply.
- Generated `course_prompt` covers every Must-Specify bullet in `references/course-prompt.md` Rules 1–12 (audit each section against its rule list — especially `# Drawing`, which is the most commonly under-filled section).

---

## Deployment

Ship optimized Teaching Prompts to the AI-Shifu platform as live courses. Two distinct actions are involved and should not be conflated:

- **Deploy** — upload local course files to the platform via `build` + `import`. After this the course exists on the platform but is not yet visible to learners on a public URL.
- **Publish** — run `publish` on the platform, which pushes the current draft to the public student-facing URL. Only after this step does `<base>/c/<bid>` (no `preview=true`) work.

The standard end-to-end flow chains both: build → import (deploy) → publish.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 with `requests` and `python-dotenv` packages installed.
- CLI script: `{skillDir}/scripts/shifu-cli.py`

### Authentication

When no valid token is available, guide the user through `shifu-cli.py login` (SMS flow: phone number + 4-digit verification code; CLI defaults to `https://ai-shifu.yipuwh.com`). Full flow in `references/cli/cli-reference.md#authentication`.

Always use CLI commands. Never make raw HTTP/API calls directly.

### Course Directory

Teaching Prompts must be organized in a course directory (one MarkdownFlow file per lesson under `lessons/`) before deployment. See `references/cli/course-directory-spec.md` for the full specification. When continuing from Optimization (Path A), write the optimized Teaching Prompts and Course Prompt into this structure automatically.

### CLI Commands

All commands documented in `references/cli/cli-reference.md` (deployment: `build` / `import` / `publish` / `show`; management for Path D: `list` / `update-meta` / `update-lesson` / `rename-lesson` / `reorder` / `delete-lesson` / `archive`). JSON schema in `references/cli/import-json-format.md`.

### Deployment Workflow

**From pipeline (Path A continuation):**
1. Write Optimization outputs into the course directory: `lessons/lesson-*.md`, `README.md`, `course-prompt.md` (the Optimization `course_prompt` artifact, structured per `references/course-prompt.md#fillable-template`), optional `structure.json`.
2. Run `build --course-dir <dir>` to generate `shifu-import.json`.
3. **Deploy**: Run `import --new --json-file <dir>/shifu-import.json` to upload the course onto the platform.
4. **Publish**: Run `publish <shifu_bid>` to push the course to its public student-facing URL.
5. Verify via platform URL.

**Standalone deployment (Path C):**
1. Ensure course directory is ready with Teaching Prompt files (one MarkdownFlow file per lesson under `lessons/`) and a `course-prompt.md`. If the Course Prompt is not yet authored, follow `references/course-prompt.md#fillable-template` (and `references/course-prompt.md#authoring-rules` for guidance) before running `build`.
2. Run `build` → `import` (deploy) → `publish` as above.

### Verification

After any deployment or management operation, verify the result:
1. Show the user the verification URLs the script printed — admin console, course preview, and (when the script also printed it) the published public URL. Copy URLs verbatim from the script output and render each as three lines: a Markdown link, a bare URL on the next line for copy-friendliness, and a third line with the fixed Chinese description (per `references/report-template.md` — Deployment → Verification URLs, plus the top-level Formatting Rules exception). Never reconstruct URLs from a template by hand. Lesson-level URLs are intentionally omitted to keep the report scannable; if the user later asks for a specific lesson link, use `show <shifu_bid>` to find the `outline_bid` and build it on demand.
2. Use `show <shifu_bid>` to get the lesson `outline_bid`, then check each lesson's Teaching Prompt, variable collection, and interaction logic.

### Validation

- Import completes without errors.
- Course is accessible via platform URL.
- Lesson count and structure match the source directory.
- Published course is reachable in preview mode.

---

## Analytics

Post-deployment data queries on live courses. Trigger this section whenever a course author or admin asks about learner count, completion rate, stuck lessons, orders, revenue, ratings, follow-up Q&A volume, credit consumption, audience profile distribution, or individual learner tracking.

### CLI-Only Rule

**All analytics traffic goes through `scripts/shifu-cli.py`. Never write raw HTTP, never read tokens directly, never compose `Authorization` / `Token` headers by hand.** Two analytics commands cover the surface:

- `shifu-cli.py analytics-query <bid> --dsl '<json-body>'` — DSL queries against the whitelisted tables (`learn_progress_records`, `learn_generated_blocks`, `learn_lesson_feedbacks`, `order_orders`, `var_variable_values`, `shifu_user_archives`, `user_users`, `shifu_published_shifus`, `shifu_draft_shifus`). The agent's job is to translate a user question into a DSL JSON body and pass it to the CLI.
- `shifu-cli.py credit-detail <bid> [--start … --end … --scene 1203 --usage-type 1101 …]` — server-side join of `bill_usage` × `credit_ledger_entries` for credit consumption queries. Use this whenever the user asks about credits / spend, **not** a DSL query against `bill_daily_usage_metrics` (that table is empty in production until the daily aggregation cron is enabled). `--scene 1203` restricts to learner-driven spend (preview is `1202`, debug is `1201`).

### Workflow

1. **Resolve credentials** — reuse the Deployment authentication. If `.env` lacks a valid `SHIFU_TOKEN`, guide the user through `shifu-cli.py login` per `references/cli/cli-reference.md#agent-login-flow`.
2. **Resolve the course** — run `shifu-cli.py list` (or `shifu-cli.py find-title <keyword>`) to map `shifu_bid ↔ course name`. **If the user mentioned a course by title**, always resolve the *current* `shifu_bid → title` via Course Metadata recipes 0a / 0b in `references/analytics/recipes.md` before issuing downstream queries — `list` is a draft snapshot and can show stale or historical titles. Never report a historical title as the course's current name.
3. **Resolve the outline** (only for course-level analysis) — run `shifu-cli.py show <shifu_bid>` to map `outline_item_bid → name / position`. Skipping this makes outline-dimension numbers unreadable.
4. **Run DSL queries** — `shifu-cli.py analytics-query <shifu_bid> --dsl '<json-body>'` (or `--dsl-file query.json` for long bodies).
5. **Translate before presenting** — pass every result through the Translation Gate in `references/analytics/privacy-and-presentation.md`. Never paste raw codes (`601`, `502`, `1101`), raw `*_bid` strings, or raw `user_bid` values in user-facing output.

### References

- `references/analytics/overview.md` — entry point, full workflow, error codes
- `references/analytics/dsl.md` — DSL grammar (operators, aggregates, constraints, per-learner guard rail, auto-applied filters, creator-scoped metadata tables)
- `references/analytics/tables.md` — 10 tables, fields, all code/enum translation tables, ID translation rules, duplicate-row trap, role = 2 ≠ follow-up trap, "course title is not history" rule
- `references/analytics/recipes.md` — Course Metadata 0a–0c + 23 numbered scenario recipes (including four-key follow-up pairing and follow-ups per lesson)
- `references/analytics/privacy-and-presentation.md` — `user_users` restricted access, `generated_content` whitelist, `var_variable_values.value` aggregate-only rule, "course title is not history" hard rule, Translation Gate, refusal rules

### Validation

- Token resolved through the Deployment Authentication path, not a hand-rolled lookup.
- When the user mentioned a course by title, the current `shifu_bid → title` was confirmed via Course Metadata Recipe 0a / 0b before the downstream query ran. Historical titles were never substituted for current ones.
- `shifu_bid` and outline mappings established before any course-level query.
- DSL body matches grammar in `dsl.md`; filters reflect the user's intent (e.g. `status = 502` for "paid", not `>= 502`).
- Credit consumption queries use `shifu-cli.py credit-detail` (server-side join). Do **not** issue a DSL query against `bill_daily_usage_metrics` — it is empty in production pending the daily aggregation cron. To restrict to learner-driven spend pass `--scene 1203` (preview is `1202`, debug is `1201`).
- Follow-up counts anchored on `type = 321` (not `role = 2`), and rely on the API's auto-injected `status = 1` rather than an explicit clause.
- Translation Gate applied before the answer is shown.
- Privacy refusals honoured for inaccessible fields (phone, email, real name, ID number, avatar, birthday).
- When CLI output contains Chinese characters that appear garbled in the agent's Bash tool, write output to a UTF-8 file and read with the file-reading tool instead (see `references/cli/cli-reference.md#cli-output--encoding`).
- Table name verified against the 10 whitelisted tables in `tables.md`. Never guess a table name — invalid names trigger `11003`.

---

## Report Template
